    "* Categorisation, if, literally interpreted, is putting certain elements together which are seemingly related to form an association. This is one of the ways how people classify things in real life, in order to organise and perceive the world around them. \n",
    "* However, even if we do classify elements together, form an association, and come up with a final product of so called a “theory”, if we may not be able to analyse, formalise, and mechanise, this process is strictly homuncular, which we call a naturalistic imperative. \n",
    "* To give an example of what this is, we can look at the following three cases. For instance, first, let us look at an example, of Descartes. \n",
    "    * This mathematician came up with the cartesian coordinates in the field of mathematics. How this mathematician figured this method, was by looking at the corner of the ceiling where flies where flying in directions. \n",
    "    * He was able to visualise this image, and he formalised a way how to graph certain things, which is what we know nowadays as Cartesian coordinates. \n",
    "* Another scientist, which is a good example of mechanisation, is Alan Turing.\n",
    "    * Turing thought that a time will come where computers will be a substitute of humans, which nowaday exists as for example, bots. In the future, maybe 30% of the humans cannot tell in between computers and humans. \n",
    "    * After thinking this, Turing formalised and mechanised how essentially computers work, in terms of producing intelligence, what we know as today, “Artificial Intelligence”. Now, here comes a Turing test, in which we test a machine’s ability of intelligence that is not distinguishable in between humans and machines.\n",
    "*  A third figure that we must look into, is a philosopher names Thales, who contributed in terms of analysing a phenomenon. For instance, this philosopher came up with three properties: \n",
    "    * 1. All is the moist, where everything is made of water which emphasises the fundamental building block of everything in this world\n",
    "    * 2. The lodestone has psyche(is moist), which states that everything moves on its own and us humans and even animals share the same properties \n",
    "    * 3. Everything is filled with Gods, which states that even a small little detail is worth looking into.\n",
    "* These properties sums up the whole definition of how to analyse a theory, in which we must break every element down in a theory of a phenomenon in order for us to completely interpret and understand it.\n"

In other words, there is no direct literal correlation gradient; rather it is a very complex thing that cannot be generalised. Even though we may have a lot of feature lists of typical elements, we cannot assume that these are separable directly, which makes this into an infinite regression."

    "    * We may assume that it is probably what a specific being had thought of such, and developed a common ground theory. However, here comes the Purity code proposed by Mary Douglas, where different cultures and backgrounds have an effect in terms of interpretation of concepts, which kills the possibility of having a mutual commonground for everyone when developing theories. \n",
    "    * For example, if we want to develop a general theory where hair is dirty, some people may argue while hair is on our heads it is not dirty, if that hair falls elsewhere out of your head, then it is considered dirty. Other people might say “why? it is still hair..just because it has fallen into another location it does not mean it is dirty.” \n",
    "    * This is not an exception for real life, as in courses such as culture. When we discuss arguments in terms of ethics, we may find practises found in other cultures to be seen as inhumane and savage, whereas to the people who practise it, it may not be seen in such way. \n",
    "        * Therefore, if we try to argue this against those people, the argument will never end, as we are inclined to our own perspective of culture, and so does the same thing applied to them. This is analogous to synaptic integration, as in order to actively engage theories together and interpret them together, we need to integrate many ideas as possible. \n",
    "        * If this is not present due to our purity code, then there is a huge problem of what we try to accomplish in the end, which is integrating everything together."
