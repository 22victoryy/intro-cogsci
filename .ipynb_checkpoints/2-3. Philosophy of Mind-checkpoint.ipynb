    "Intelligent design is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as \"an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins rather than natural selection. Although this was accepted previouslyy, it is not accepted due to the mind body problem. If mind and body are different substances with different essences, the way how they interact cannot be explained.\n",

According to him, the whole cartesian position is created by a series of categorical mistakes.\n",
