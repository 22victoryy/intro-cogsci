    "* Categorisation, if, literally interpreted, is putting certain elements together which are seemingly related to form an association. This is one of the ways how people classify things in real life, in order to organise and perceive the world around them. \n",
    "* However, even if we do classify elements together, form an association, and come up with a final product of so called a “theory”, if we may not be able to analyse, formalise, and mechanise, this process is strictly homuncular, which we call a naturalistic imperative. \n",
    "* To give an example of what this is, we can look at the following three cases. For instance, first, let us look at an example, of Descartes. \n",
    "    * This mathematician came up with the cartesian coordinates in the field of mathematics. How this mathematician figured this method, was by looking at the corner of the ceiling where flies where flying in directions. \n",
    "    * He was able to visualise this image, and he formalised a way how to graph certain things, which is what we know nowadays as Cartesian coordinates. \n",
    "* Another scientist, which is a good example of mechanisation, is Alan Turing.\n",
    "    * Turing thought that a time will come where computers will be a substitute of humans, which nowaday exists as for example, bots. In the future, maybe 30% of the humans cannot tell in between computers and humans. \n",
    "    * After thinking this, Turing formalised and mechanised how essentially computers work, in terms of producing intelligence, what we know as today, “Artificial Intelligence”. Now, here comes a Turing test, in which we test a machine’s ability of intelligence that is not distinguishable in between humans and machines.\n",
    "*  A third figure that we must look into, is a philosopher names Thales, who contributed in terms of analysing a phenomenon. For instance, this philosopher came up with three properties: \n",
    "    * 1. All is the moist, where everything is made of water which emphasises the fundamental building block of everything in this world\n",
    "    * 2. The lodestone has psyche(is moist), which states that everything moves on its own and us humans and even animals share the same properties \n",
    "    * 3. Everything is filled with Gods, which states that even a small little detail is worth looking into.\n",
    "* These properties sums up the whole definition of how to analyse a theory, in which we must break every element down in a theory of a phenomenon in order for us to completely interpret and understand it.\n"
