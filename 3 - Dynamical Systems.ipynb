    "As the comp func and id theory failed, juerrero goes through kant's work to explain alternative solutions which mainly concern the buildings of a virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Juerrero review's Kant's work in terms of causation, and concludes that our explanations tend to be flawed due to the origin of the causation. For example, A leaf come to be a tree. But a tree becomes to be a...tree, which is circular. Rather than this, he suggested that these systems were dynamical systems, where constraints were put in terms of probabilities of events occuring(which is self organising).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some constraints increase/decrease the probability of happening. A good example is explanation of natural selection. This does a feedback process. By Scarcity, it puts selective pressure on organisms and results in the inferior ones to deterioriate. However, genetic variation allows various more organisms to evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, juerrero suggests that selective constraits are virtual governors, and enabling constraits are virtual generators., which creates a feedback system. Therefore, we are able to retrieve intelligence from non-intelligent materials by the avoidance of circular explanation(homoncular fashion), through this type of dynamical system. This ends the homonuclar fallacy that the other theories had.\n",

    "# Third Virtual Engine to the End\n",
    "So now, we have a new virtual engine that goes between exploitation and exploration (which Piaget dubs assimilation and accommodation).\n",
    "We can then conclude that compression is the same as particularisation which is the same as exploitation which is the same as assimilation - roughly.\n",
    "we also have evidence from neuroscience appears to do this when firing where it goes between synchrony and asynchrony\n",
    "what we can derive from this is evidence for self organising criticality and this is where the vervaeke and Ferrero (2013) study comes in. They suggest that general intelligence is RR because of self organising criticality\n",
    "so essentially they propose that we can measure how intelligent a system (such as brains or our networks we are trying to develop) is by how they optimise between efficiency and resiliency by self organising into small world networks.\n",
    "This is something that has been further proved and supported by Thatalor et al 2012, and by Hasse and Gross 2014 to be a very plausible explanation for the criterion of the cognitive\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides us with a plausible dynamical systems theory of how relevance realisation occurs in terms of a virtual engine that regulates the sensimotor loop so that is constantly evolving its fittedness to the environment\n",
    "using these we can also provide a final conclusion to original meaning.\n",
    "This comes from kolehinksy and walport in 2018.\n",
    "They suggest semantic information is syntactic information that a physical system has about its environment which is causally necessary for the system to maintain itself and for this to work we require a system that is adaptive auto poetic so then we can conclude from this that you can derive original meaning by linking RR and adaptive auto-poetic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially we can use any syntactic information (any formal information or patterns between events) and through a process of RR zero in on it, so that we can incorporate it into our sensimotor loop so that we can solve our problems and achieve our goals, then it becomes original meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So by solving the relevance realisiation problem, we then effectively solve the original meaning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "However we are still left with the consciousness problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is the function of consciousness and the other is the nature of consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is the function of consciousness and the other is the nature of consciousness ---- we can find a plausible answer to the function of consciousness problem for Baars and his global work space theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not done however. Consciousness makes things salient to you (to make a field of obviousness to you - by a process of OBVIATION ( to make things obvious to anticipate and avoid bad situations)) in a particular way to you, in order to make things obvious to you - you have to learn it and it is constantly evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets make another virtual engine to explain this process of obviation (which is also the nature of consciousness).\n",
    "We can root out virtual engine in something called sizing up.\n",
    "(sizing up is a process by which we identify features of something (like the idiom whereby we size something up).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we have is a process of featurisation where some features are foregrounding, some are backgrounding, some features are figured (configured or otherwise), and there is a background of unified things that eventually fade off into a background non-unified things. On top of that there is framing which can frame particular problems form these features\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this we can then derive a a dynamically self organising process that is being constantly being done to create a perpetually salient landscape (it is doing obviation by featuring, foregrounding, figuration, and framing).\n",
    "\n",
    "But you could argue that there are situation where things are not salient, in which case the standard answer is we solve these problems via intuition, which is also something that can be explained by self organising criticality so we have a derived a distinct answer to the function of consciousness.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have left is the distinct nature of consciousnes.\n",
    "We can derive this by arguing that there are two different features of consciousness - namely adverbial and adjectival. Adjectival features are not necessary nor sufficient for consciousness (see the pure consciousness event for an example) so then we are left with adverbial features of which there are three: Aspectuality - togetherness, Centravity - hereness, Temporality - nowness."
